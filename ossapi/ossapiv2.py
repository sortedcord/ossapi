        This is where the magic happens. Since python lacks a good
        deserialization library, I've opted to use type annotations and type
        annotations only to convert json to objects. A breakdown follows.

        Every endpoint defines a base object, let's say it's a ``Score``. We
        first instantiate this object with the json we received. This is easy to
        do because (almost) all of our objects are dataclasses, which means we
        can pass the json as ``Score(**json)`` and since the names of our fields
        coincide with the names of the api json keys, everything works.

        This populates all of the surface level members, but nested attributes
        which are annotated as another dataclass object will still be dicts. So
        we traverse down the tree of our base object's attributes (depth-first,
        though I'm pretty sure BFS would work just as well), looking for any
        attribute with a type annotation that we need to deal with. For
        instance, ``Score`` has a ``beatmap`` attribute, which is annotated as
        ``Optional[Beatmap]``. We ignore the optional annotation (since we're
        looking at this attribute, we must have received data for it, so it's
        nonnull) and then instantiate the ``beatmap`` attribute the same way
        we instantiated the ``Score`` - with ``Beatmap(**json)``. Of course, the
        variables will look different in the method (``type_(**value)``).

        Finally, when traversing the attribute tree, we also look for attributes
        which aren't dataclasses, but we still need to convert. For instance,
        any attribute with an annotation of ``datetime`` or ``Mod`` we convert
        to a ``datetime`` and ``Mod`` object respectively.

        This code is arguably trying to be too smart for its own good, but I
        think it's very elegant from the perspective of "just add a dataclass
        that mirrors the api's objects and everything works". Will hopefully
        make changing our dataclasses to account for breaking api changes in
        the future trivial as well.

        And if I'm being honest, it was an excuse to learn the internals of
        python's typing system.
